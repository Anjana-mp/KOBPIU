## Abstract

KochiOrgBook public identity utility, an identity network for the city of Kochi. All the DIDs will be hosted upon the identity network. This network which is going to be the 1st layer of ToIP tecnology stack. The first layer is mainly for blockchains and distributed ledgers. The identity utility network is similar to that of Sovrin network.

## Motivation

As Individuals and Organizations use variety of credentials and documents for different purpose and we share those documents in internet. These credentials and documents serve as a unique identifiers which gives our communication addresses, ID Numbers and other personal informations. Sharing these personalized information in the Internet is not safe, attackers can get the information and can use them.  So we are using a new type of gloablly unique identifiers called DIDs which helps individuals and organizations to generate our own identifiers using systems we trust, and to prove control of those identifiers (authenticate) using cryptographic proofs (for example, digital signatures).
And at the same time the users have independent existence. If we are using the identities digitally it must be long lived and it is very easy for transportation. The user's rights are protected while using DIDs. 
## Status of the project

Incubation state.

## Solution
Creating a new public utility-precisely what the “Internet for identity” should be-requires a
way to store identifiers, keys, pointers and proofs without relying on centralized authorities.
Using such a mechanism, an individual or organization can build up a sequence of identity
transactions which can reliably prove their identity. The main aim of KOBPIU is developing a network for these types of identities. The KOBPIU Network, a public permissioned ledger for self-sovereign identity. These identities operate as public utilities and where the underlying blockchain is foundationally like an “identity internet”. In the identity network, DIDs will be hosted. Decentralized identifiers are one of the foundational idea for supporting these types of identities. Each user create their identities which is independent of central authority. These identities form a public identity network in which the holder can use and share their identities. Each identities have their own URIs that makes the interaction with specific documents.Each document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services. The  participants of Identifiers are Issuer, Holder and the Verifier. The Issuer can issue the documents and Prover can prove their identity to the verifier without interacting with the issuer. These network provides trust, personal control, and ease-of-use of analog IDs. This Network cannot be owned or controlled by any single company, organization, or government. Instead they must be distributed around the city of Kochi, operated by trusted institutions and industries in the city, forming a decentralised network much like the Internet itself. And like the Internet, they must all run the same distributed consensus protocol that has been publicly vetted for security and privacy.

KOB Public Identity Utility aims at developing an Identity network for the city of Kochi. In which users can generate and manage their own identities. These identities operate as public utilities and where the underlying blockchain is foundationally like an “identity network”. Decentralized identifiers are one of the foundational idea for supporting these types of identities.DIDs are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. DID is the idea that you control your own data, you control when and how it is provided to others and when it is shared, It is done so in a trusted way. In contrast to typical, identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be independent of centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Individuals or Organizations can prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party.DIDs provide URIs that makes the interaction with specific documents.Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID Controllers to prove control of the DID. Services enable trusted interactions associated with the DID subject. A DID might provide the means to return the DID subject itself, if the subject is an information resource such as a data model. The  participants of Identifiers are Issuer, Holder and the Verifier. The Issuer can issue the documents and Prover can prove their identity to the verifier without interacting with the issuer.
